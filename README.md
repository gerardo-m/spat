# spat
A very simple "Static PAge Translator" in javascript (no dependencies)

## How to use

- Mark all the elements you want to translate with unique ids
- Create a folder named "spat" at the root of your site, and add a json file for every language you want to support
- Add the event to change languages: Spat.setLanguage('<language>')

## ROADMAP

- Add option to use a different folder for the language files
- Add some tooling to generate the language files
- Improve this README lol
